                                I do. I originally studied Graphic Design in Southampton. The design world was beautiful
                                (websites, logos, typography), and the detail-orientated nature was relatable, but I
                                never connected with the design craft. Designing never brought the joy I thought it
                                would.<br><br>This led me to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Bath in
                                Management,
                                with my thinking being, “Hey, if I don’t enjoy actually designing, maybe I will enjoy
                                managing design projects”.<br><br>This hypothesis was partly true. I like it, but it
                                isn’t
                                quite that final bowl of Goldilock’s porridge.

                                The Odin Project was brilliant. It was free, an excellent curriculum, and it threw you
                                in the deep end to work things out on your own. As I near the completion of the
                                foundation course, I want to extend my knowledge, build my ability to talk about it,
                                teach it and create code collaboratively with others.<br><br>It is a gratifying
                                activity to do on your own, but you need the ability to communicate the reasons behind the code to be
                                successful in the industry. The cherry on top is the non-profit nature of Founders and Coders.
                                Supporting a non-profit initiative through participation falls firmly within my morals.
