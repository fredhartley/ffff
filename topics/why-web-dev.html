                                When I first started, I thought there was no chance I could do it, and it was
                                far-fetched for me even to consider it as a path. However, after working my way through
                                The Odin Project, I realised that it is essential to overcome these doubts to learn this
                                craft. Everyone has them when they start.<br><br>Coding challenges you intellectually

                                ensure you are kind to yourself. I love this.<br><br>I also love the detail-orientated

                                of the craft. Shall I use a switch case or event listener? How should I name my classes?
                                There is no definitive answer to these questions, but as you continue learning, you form
                                educated opinions that build the foundation of your knowledge.<br><br>The more time I

                                The Odin Project was brilliant. It was free, an excellent curriculum, and it threw you
                                in the deep end to work things out on your own. As I near the completion of the
                                foundation course, I want to extend my knowledge, build my ability to talk about it,
                                teach it and create code collaboratively with others.<br><br>It is a gratifying
                                activity to do on your own, but you need the ability to communicate the reasons behind the code to be
                                successful in the industry. The cherry on top is the non-profit nature of FAC.
                                Supporting a non-profit initiative through participation falls firmly within my morals.

                                I work with a developer, Marc, at my current job. His attention to detail and ability to
                                hone down to the ‘why’ of each line of code are phenomenal, as well as his high skill in
                                asking the right questions. I suspect this is why he rarely deploys buggy code.
