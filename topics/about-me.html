                                people’s idea of living hell. Excluding football, these activities offer me times of
                                reflection and are invaluable to my life.<br><br>Football... well, it allows me to be
                                irrationally passionate for a couple of hours a week over something very trivial.

                                I do. I originally studied Graphic Design in Southampton. The design world was beautiful
                                (websites, logos, typography), and the detail-orientated nature was relatable, but I
                                never connected with the design craft. Designing never brought the joy I thought it
                                would.<br><br>This led me to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Bath in
                                Management,
                                with my thinking being, “Hey, if I don’t enjoy actually designing, maybe I will enjoy
                                managing design projects”.<br><br>This hypothesis was partly true. I like it, but it
                                isn’t
                                quite that final bowl of Goldilock’s porridge.
